# Signals, Sensors and Sound Coding Workshop

*November 22 and 23, 2024; LIVELab, Department Department of Psychology, Neuroscience &amp; Behaviour, McMaster University*

This repository contains materials for a workshop on music and physiological signals, presented by members of the BEAT lab at McMaster University. 

# Workshop Description

One-Day Workshop for ages 16+

Music and the responses it evokes in the brain and body can all be thought of as signals that vary over time. In this hands-on workshop, we will discuss how to measure and interact with these time-varying signals. Additionally, we will create our own musical interfaces using touch sensors and mobile eye-tracking glasses connected to programmable circuit boards!

Students will have the opportunity to learn the fundamentals of music cognition, digital signal processing, and computer programming from experts in the LIVELab. They will exercise creative autonomy in developing new musical interfaces and will have the opportunity to work collaboratively to form multi-instrument ensembles.

# Workshop Materials

**1. Introduction to computational music analysis**

The workshop starts with an introduction to what music is and how we approach music cognition as a research interest [TODO link to slides](TODO link to slides). Next, students learned the basics of computational music analysis in Python with a Google Colab notebook: [https://colab.research.google.com/github/beatlab-mcmaster/workshop_signalsensorsound/blob/main/audioanalysis.ipynb](https://colab.research.google.com/github/beatlab-mcmaster/workshop_signalsensorsound/blob/main/audioanalysis.ipynb).

**2. Introduction to heart rate measurement and analysis**

TODO

**3. Introduction to eye tracking for music research and for collaborative music making**
