# Physiological signals

## Audio signals

We have just learned how physical sounds are represented as audio signals.

## Audio signals

...and we can analyse these signals to describe and reveal many of the underlying properties that make up sound.

## Physiological signals

Our bodies also generate signals.

## Physiological signals

Psychologists are interested in these signals as well---what can they tell us about underlying properties of human behaviour, cognition, and perception?

# The heart

Overview

## Cardiac anatomy

![The heart circulates blood, rich in oxygen, nutrients, hormones, etc., throughout the body with precision [@berntson-2017-cardiovascular-psychophysiology].](./images/2017-psychophysiology-heart.png)

## The cardiac cycle

![\[Note the bottom line: the Electrocardiogram\] The cardiac cycle consists of a large voltage 'spike' from cells in the heart, causing the heart to contract (*systole*, pushing blood into the body); followed by a period of relaxation (*diastole*, where the heart refills with blood from the body) [@berntson-2017-cardiovascular-psychophysiology].](./images/2017-psychophysiology-cycle.png)

# Why is this interesting?

## Intrinsic rhythms

![Only a few organs produce internal bodily rhythms. These rhythms are affected by bodily states [@engelen-2023-interoceptive-rhythms-in-the-brain].](./images/2023-interoceptive-rhythms.png)

## The heart *is influenced by* our nervous system

![The autonomic nervous system (ANS) coordinates all of our organs [@purves-2018-neuroscience].](./images/2018-neuroscience-ans.png)

## The heart also *influences* our nervous system

![The heart in connected by both efferent *and* afferent neurons (so, the brain *sends* and *receives* information from the heart) [@purves-2018-neuroscience].](./images/2018-neuroscience-heart.png)

## We can (easily\*) detect cardiac signals!

# Measuring cardiac activity

## Electrocardiogram (ECG/EKG)

![Electrical potentials produced by the heart [@2014-figure-bundle-branch-block]](./images/BBB-physiology.jpg)

## Electrocardiogram (ECG/EKG)

![Combine to produce a waveform](./images/2012-ECG-signal-processing.png)

## Photoplethysmogram (PPG)

![Changes in blood volume are detected with light [@charlton-2022-wearable-photoplethysmography-cardiovascular-monitoring]](./images/2022-wearable-ppg-wrist.png)

## Photoplethysmogram (PPG)

![Blood volume cycles in phase with the heart [@charlton-2022-wearable-photoplethysmography-cardiovascular-monitoring]](./images/2022-wearable-ppg-pulse.png)

## Photoplethysmogram (PPG)

![Here is what the detected blood pulse looks like as a PPG signal [@charlton-2022-wearable-photoplethysmography-cardiovascular-monitoring]](./images/2022-wearable-ppg-signal.png)
